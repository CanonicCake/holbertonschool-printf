Printf was a challage start to finish, leading us down to reresearch seitch case functions, and how to translate that to if statemnets. Ultimatly it was more simplified than we thought, where the code had gone through 4-5 iterations before we landed on the very last push. It gave us more of an idea going into the decimals (change on day two) 

Going back to variadic functions, we've based it around the unlimited possibilities due to not knowing how large the argument passed in would wind up becoming. So we set up a variadic list to start that would pass functions between argunments depedning on what was being asked of the function, hence a string or a character.

When working to push the characters and printf functions, we ran into a merge conflict that, while not taking very long, had us realizing we should have pulled and merged and then pushed. Fixing it required a pull, a reset, a merge, a push on a different side, and then another pull before being able to push once more. Now uptodate we can continue working on integers and decimals.
